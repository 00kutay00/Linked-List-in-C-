# Singly Linked List in C++

## What is Linked List?
  A Linked List is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes. Each node contains its own data and a pointer (link) to the next node in the sequence.

## Why Linked List?
  1. Dynamic Size: LinkedList is a dynamically resizable data structure. There is no fixed capacity limit when adding or removing elements.
  2. Fast Insertion/Deletion: Insertions and deletions at the beginning or middle of the list take O(1) or O(n) time, making it more efficient than structures like ArrayList.
  3. Memory Efficiency: LinkedList allocates memory for nodes only when needed, avoiding unnecessary memory overhead.
  4. Flexible Data Structure: It can be implemented in different variations such as Doubly LinkedList or Circular LinkedList.
  5. High-Performance Iteration: Iterators allow efficient traversal and modification of data.
  6. Queue and Stack Implementations: LinkedList is ideal for implementing Queue and Stack data structures.
  7. No Memory Copying Overhead: Unlike ArrayList, LinkedList does not require copying elements to a new array when resizing.

## Where Are Linked Lists Used?
  1. Dynamic Memory Management
     - Used when programs require flexible memory allocation.
  2. Stack and Queue Implementations
     - Singly Linked List for Stack, Doubly Linked List for Queue.
  3. Graph and Tree Data Structures
     - Adjacency lists in graphs, child node linking in trees.
  4. File Systems and Databases
     - Managing disk blocks in a linked manner.
  5. Browser History and Undo/Redo Operations
      - Tracking sequential actions.
  6. Polynomial and Large Number Arithmetic
      - Flexible storage of digits or terms.
  7. Operating Systems (Process Scheduling, Memory Management)
      - Managing running processes with linked lists.
